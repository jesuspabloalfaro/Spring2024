## Evaluation of CPU Schedulers by Simulation
![[Pasted image 20240331215316.png]]
- System can generate traces like this to simulate a process in a real system "offline"
- Will be fed into systems that implement different scheduling algorithms

## Implementation

- Evaluating a scheduling algorthim in a simulation doesn't always mean it will be the same in a real system
